# League of Legends Performance Modeling

# üìä Introduction to the Dataset  

In this project, we explore how a player's **position** in *League of Legends* affects their **in-game performance** and how we can use **performance statistics** to **predict a player‚Äôs position**. *League of Legends* is a team-based strategy game where players take on distinct roles‚Äî**Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, and Support**‚Äîeach with unique responsibilities and playstyles.  

## ‚ùì Why Does This Matter?  
Understanding how **in-game performance** relates to **player position** has multiple valuable applications:  
- üîπ **Competitive Insights:** Helps players and coaches analyze role-based performance trends.  
- üîπ **Automated Role Detection:** Can improve matchmaking and gameplay analysis tools.  
- üîπ **Esports & Game Analytics:** Supports data-driven strategies in professional and amateur play.  

## üìà Dataset Overview  
The dataset consists of **123,223 rows**, where each row represents a **player‚Äôs performance in a completed game**. The key columns relevant to our analysis include:  

| üè∑Ô∏è Column Name  | üìñ Description |  
|------------------|-------------|  
| **position** | The role the player took in the game (**Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, Support**). This is our **target variable** for prediction. |  
| **kills** | Number of enemy champions eliminated by the player. |  
| **deaths** | Number of times the player was eliminated. |  
| **assists** | Number of times the player helped eliminate an enemy champion. |  
| **monsterkills** | Number of neutral monsters slain (e.g., jungle camps). |  
| **minionkills** | Number of lane minions killed for gold and experience. |  
| **dpm** (*Damage Per Minute*) | Average damage dealt to enemy champions per minute. |  
| **earned gpm** (*Earned Gold Per Minute*) | Rate at which the player accumulates in-game currency. |  
| **champion** | The specific champion the player used in the game, which may influence performance patterns. |  

By analyzing these **performance statistics**, we aim to uncover how **different roles** impact in-game performance and how we can **effectively predict a player‚Äôs position** based on these metrics.  

# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data Cleaning


### Selecting Relevant Columns
To save time in the further data cleaning steps, we first only kept the relevant columns: `gameid`, `datacompleteness`, `date`, `game`, `side`, `position`, `playername`, `playerid`, `champion`, `gamelength`, `result`, `kills`, `deaths`, `assists`, `totalgold`, `total cs`, `earned gpm`, `damagetochampions`, `dpm`, `minionkills`, and `monsterkills`. This reduced the dataset size to include only the necessary information for analysis.

```python
df = df[['gameid', 'datacompleteness', 'date', 'game', 'side', 'position', 
         'playername', 'playerid', 'champion', 'gamelength', 'result', 
         'kills', 'deaths', 'assists', 'totalgold', 'total cs', 'earned gpm', 
         'damagetochampions', 'dpm', 'minionkills', 'monsterkills']]
```

| gameid        | datacompleteness | date                | game | side | position   | playername | playerid                                | champion | gamelength | result | kills | deaths | assists | totalgold | total cs | earned gpm | damagetochampions | dpm     | minionkills | monsterkills |
